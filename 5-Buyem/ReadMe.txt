I developed this application in python version 3.7.4 environment
Please install pip before and run the requirements.txt file( one can use virtual environment also)
If you want you can use pymysql ( version 0.9.3 ) connector to connect the application to the MySQL database, If you want to use this than have to modify base.py and introspection.py files (check how to modify on internet)
