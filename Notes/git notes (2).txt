1) Create 3 branches Dev1, Dev2, Dev3 in master repository and create a file in each branch and merge it with master
	-To create a branch run "git branch <branchname>" in the cloned repo
	-to go to the branch/master run "git checkout <branchname/master>"
	-Create files and save it then add it by running "git add ."
	-then "git commit -m "done this changes""
	-then "git push origin <branchname>"
	-then check the status to know how commits you are ahead of (if it doesnt shows all your changes then go to your master by running "git checkout <master/origin>"
	-then to merge all the changes run "git push origin master"

2) Updating
	- Redirect your directory to the local folder from which you want update from remote repo folder
	-To get the update of changes made by others from the remote repo to local repo run "git fetch <remotename>"
	-To merge the changes made by others in remote repo to local repo run "git merge <remotename/branchname>"
	-Instead of running above 2 command we can use only 1 command which does the action of both by running "git pull <remotename> <branchname>" 
	-If we run into a merge conflict that we cannot resolve, or if we decide to quit the merge, we can use "git merge --abort" to take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled.
